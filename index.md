In this class, we will be covering the use of *bedtools*, a set of
programs used for genome arithmetic. *Bedtools* is often called the swiss-army knife of genomic analysis due to its versatility and its speed. Genome arithmetic will be extremely useful in
especially for the analysis of NGS assays, which returns genomic
coordinates following pre-processing. 

The materials from this tutorial is summarized from the official *bedtools* tutorial found at [[http://quinlanlab.org/tutorials/bedtools/bedtools.html]].
> ## Prerequistes
>
> You are expected to understand how genome arithmetic works. In this
> class, the focus is on how to do arithmetic, and not what is
> arithmetic. Feel free to give a shout-out if you are unsure of what is going on during the tutorial, and we will run through those concepts which you are still unclear of.
