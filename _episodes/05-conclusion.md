## Conclusion
In this class, we have covered the use of *bedtools* for genome arithmetic. *bedtools* is a standalone tool, which we can use *linux* pipes to string together different commands in a pipeline. As you would have noticed, there are a slew of reporting options that are implemented. It is important to be aware of what these options are, as the reporting format depends very much on what you are trying to achieve.

Genome arithmetic is not only performed using *bedtools*. The *R* package *GenomicRanges* also provides a wide range of functions for one to perform genome arithmetic. It is a worthwhile investment learning how to use *GenomicRanges* for genome arithmetic, if you are intending to do NGS analysis more extensively in *R*.
